  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Perfect for Valentine's Day, this rich and delicious chocolate pudding is made with a classic Italian method that they call "budino." The pudding has a glorious texture--firm enough to stay on the spoon and hold its shape, but at the same time, soft, smooth, and silky. It's a perfect balance between intense chocolate flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness, topped with a soft whipped cream topping that elevates it to a whole new level of amazingness!</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Puddings:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>8 ounces dark chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Topping:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shaved dark chocolate</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine chocolate chips, salt, and cayenne in a heat-proof measuring cup; set aside.</li>
    <li>Separate eggs by cracking one egg into your hand over a bowl. Open your fingers slightly and gently jiggle your hand until the egg white falls into the bowl below. Transfer the yolk to a skillet. Repeat with remaining eggs. Reserve egg whites for another use.</li>
    <li>Add sugar, milk, and cream to egg yolks. Whisk thoroughly, breaking egg yolks first, until well combined.</li>
    <li>Place skillet on the stove over medium or medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a silicone spoon, until very hot and thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should read at least 175 degrees F (79 degrees C). Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Set a fine sieve over the bowl of reserved chocolate. Strain the custard sauce into the chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk until chocolate has melted and custard sauce is smooth and shiny, about 2 minutes. Add vanilla and butter; stir until butter has melted, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Pour warm custard sauce into 6 serving glasses. Tilt each glass and rotate it around so the warm chocolate coats another 1/2 inch of the glass. Cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator until completely chilled, at least 3 to 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Combine cream and vanilla extract for topping in a metal bowl and whisk until thickened; make sure no peaks form. Spoon cream into the glasses, then tilt and twirl to coat the sides a bit.</li>
    <li>Garnish with shaved chocolate and serve.</li>
  </ol>
