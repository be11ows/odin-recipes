# odin-recipes

This was an Odin project showcasing some simple HMTL skills.  

The project includes a homepage, links to 5 recipes/pages I want to master, with photos, descriptions, ingredients and steps for each one.

Excellent food and top notch code is the goal!  Thanks for checking out the project.  In joy.
